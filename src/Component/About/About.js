                <p>In my childhood, I wanted to be a pilot. Because I used to see a lot of science fiction movies and seeing those I thought I can also fly if I become a pilot <br/><br/>

Later, when I was 11 years old. I suddenly started loving Math and Science. I was soo good at match and science that all my friends started calling me scientist <br/><br/>

And they kept calling me that till my High school ended. It was a very long time. At that time as a Bangladeshi citizen getting access to technology was too hard. Like I had my first smartphone when I was in class 10 (17 years old). Before that my Aunt bought a Chinese phone. I used that to play games and stuff. <br/><br/>

After playing a lot of games I was bored and thought why not make my own games. But I didn't know how to make my own game. I searched on the internet and I found nothing. Then I thought, ok let's make mobile apps. I searched for how to make mobile games. And I found AppGeyser where you can a template give it a name and your app is done. Was too easy but not what I wanted. <br/><br/>

Then I started learning HTML, CSS, and a little bit of Jquery. And I made my first web page. That was the beginning and now I' a Full-stack web developer and a Python developer.</p>
